not include the `AgentCheck` interface that we'll be using.

OVERVIEW
======================================================
-->

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

The Datadog Agent collects a variety of metrics and events from your system,
from system metrics like CPU, load, and memory, to metrics from a specific application
or service running on your system like PostgreSQL or Memcached.

Upon installation, the Agent is able to give you a quick and clear view of
what's happening across your infrastructure. It supports a wide variety of integrations,
and has a simple interface for writing your own checks.

In this guide, we will first show you what is available in the AgentCheck
interface, then we'll walk through writing a simple HTTP status check.

<!--
======================================================
SETUP
======================================================
-->

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

If you have not already setup the Agent, then you should check out the agent
setup instructions for your particular OS:
<a href="http://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent">http://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings#agent</a>.

If you run into any issues during the setup, don't hesistate to pop by our
<a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/datadog">chat room</a> where we'll be happy to
answer any questions you might have.

INTERFACE
======================================================
-->

<h3 id="interface">The AgentCheck Interface</h3>

All custom checks inherit from the `AgentCheck` class found in `checks/__init__.py`
and require a `check()` method that takes one argument, `instance` which is a
`dict` having the configuration of a particular instance. The `check` method is
run once per instance defined in the check configuration (discussed later)

#### Sending metrics

Sendings metrics in a check is easy! You have the following methods available to you:

<%= snippet_code_block("guides-agentchecks-methods.py") %>

The methods might look familiar if you're already worked with DogstatsD.

All of these methods take the following arguments:

- `metric`: The name of the metric
- `value`: The value for the metric (defaults to 1 on increment, -1 on decrement)
- `tags`: (optional) A list of tags to associate with this metric.
- `hostname`: (optional) A hostname to associate with this metric. Defaults to the current host.
- `device_name`: (optional) A device name to associate with this metric.

These methods may be called from anywhere within your check logic and get buffered
in memory. At the end of your `check` function, all metrics buffered in memory will
submitted to Datadog with the other agent metrics.

#### Sending events

At any time during your check, you can make a call to `self.event(...)` with one
argument: the payload of the event. Your event should be structured like this:

<%= snippet_code_block("guides-agentchecks-event.py") %>

Events also get buffered in memory until the end of your check when all events
will be submitted to Datadog with the rest of the agent payload.

#### Logging

As part of the parent class, you're given a standard Python
[logger](http://docs.python.org/release/3.1.5/library/logging.html#logger-objects)
at `self.log`, so you can do things like `self.log.info('hello')`. The log
handler will be `checks.{name}` where `{name}` is the name of your check (based
on the filename of the check module).

<!--
======================================================
CONFIGURATION
======================================================
-->

<h3 id="config">Configuration</h3>

Each check will have a configuration file that will be placed in the `conf.d`
directory. Configuration is written using [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/). The
file name should match the name of the check module (e.g.: `haproxy.py` and
`haproxy.yaml`).

The configuration file has the following structure:

<%= snippet_code_block("guides-agentchecks-config.yaml") %>

#### init_config

The *init_config* section allows you to have an arbitrary number of global configuration options that will be available on every run of the check in
`self.config`.

#### instances

The *instances* section is a list of instances that this check will be run
against. Your actual `check()` method is run once per instance. This means that
every check will support multiple instances out of the box.

<!--
======================================================
FIRST CHECK
======================================================
-->

<h3 id="first">Your First Check</h3>

Now we will guide you through the process of writing a basic check that will
check the status of an HTTP endpoint. On each run of the check, a GET
request will be made to the HTTP endpoint. Based on the response, one of the
following will happen:

  - If the response is successful (response is 200, no timeout) the response
  time will be submitted as a metric.
  - If the response times out, an event will be submitted with the URL and
  timeout.
  - If the response code != 200, an event will be submitted with the URL and
  the response code.

#### Configuration

First we will want to define how our configuration should look, so that we know
how to handle the structure of the `instance` payload that is passed into the
call to `check`.

Besides just defining a URL per call, it'd be nice to allow you to set a timeout
for each URL. We'd also want to be able to configure a default timeout if no
timeout value is given for a particular URL.

So our final configuration would look something like this:

<%= snippet_code_block("guides-agentchecks-ex-config.yaml") %>

#### The Check

Now we can start defining our check method. The main part of the check will make
a request to the URL and time the response time, handling error cases as it goes.

In this snippet, we start a timer, make the GET request using the
[requests library](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) and handle and
errors that might arise.

<%= snippet_code_block("guides-agentchecks-ex-request.py") %>

If the request passes, we want to submit the timing to Datadog as a metric. Let's
call it `http.response_time` and tag it with the URL.

<%= snippet_code_block("guides-agentchecks-ex-metric.py") %>

Finally, we'll want to define what happens in the error cases. We have already
seen that we call `self.timeout_event` in the case of a URL timeout and
we call `self.status_code_event` in the case of a bad status code. Let's
define those methods now.

First, we'll define `timeout_event`. Note that we want to aggregate all of these
events together based on the URL so we will define the `aggregation_key` as a hash
of the URL.

<%= snippet_code_block("guides-agentchecks-ex-timeout.py") %>

Next, we'll define `status_code_event` which looks very similar to the timeout
event method.

<%= snippet_code_block("guides-agentchecks-ex-status.py") %>

#### Putting All Together

For the last part of this guide, we'll show the entire check. This module would
be places into the `checks.d` folder as `http.py`. The corresponding
configuration would be placed into the `conf.d` folder as `http.yaml`.

<%= snippet_code_block("guides-agentchecks-ex-all.py") %>
